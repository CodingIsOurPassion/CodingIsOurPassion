# CodingIsOurPassion Group
This is the mono repository for our group at University of Texas at San Antonio in the Applications Programming course (CS-3443).

Our group consists of the following members:
- [Ethan Grams](https://github.com/egramsdoescode)
- [Salman Abid](https://github.com/SlummyBoi)
- [Gavin Diab](https://github.com/HiIAmGrey)
- [Price Hiller](https://github.com/PriceHiller/)

We chose to build an application named `LakeWatch` for our project. The intent is for it to present data about [Canyon
Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wikiCanyon_Lake_%28Texas%29) in an Android application applying principles learned in our
Application Programming course.

## Organization of this Repository

- `LakeWatchAPI` contains the backend service behind our Android application
- `LakeWatch` contains the main Android application for our project
- `LakeWatchScraper` contains the scraper service that goes out to various sites and actually pulls the data we need for the API.
- `Meetings` contains our meeting notes

For more details please see the individual `README` of each project as applicable.
